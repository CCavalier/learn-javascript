# Getting Started With the Terminal, Git, and Node

Most of the courses will require you to have a working bash terminal, git, and Node.

Node will be used for both server-side and client-side programming in JavaScript, and npm, which comes with Node, is the standard package manager for Node, meaning that it's how you'll access all the open source libraries available for use in your projects.

## Installing Node

If you want to install Node, there are two ways I recommend:

* For OS X and Linux, [use nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* For Windows, use [the official installer](https://nodejs.org/)

For OS X and Linux, nvm solves permissions issues that you'd normally encounter with the default installer, and it also allows you to easily manage multiple versions of Node, so you can test your code using different versions of the Node engine. Very handy!
